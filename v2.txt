Pixel Lab API

The API provides endpoints for creating AI-generated pixel art images, rotations, animations, and more. Making it easy for applications to integrate pixel art generation capabilities.
AI Assistant Integration

For use with AI assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.), use the auto-generated documentation:

https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/llms.txt

Python Client

For convenience, a Python client library is available to simplify integration with your applications. Visit our GitHub repository for installation instructions and examples.

pip install pixellab

Authentication

The API uses a simple token based authentication system. After creating an account, you can find your API token in your account settings. Include this token in all API requests using the Bearer authentication scheme:

curl -X POST https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/create-image-pixflux \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "description": "cute dragon",
        "image_size": {"width": 128, "height": 128}
    }'

Or use the Python client:

import pixellab

client = pixellab.Client(secret="YOUR_API_TOKEN")
client.create_image_pixflux(
    description="cute dragon",
    image_size=dict(width=128, height=128),
)

Tileset creation started, returns job ID
Create top-down tileset (async processing)​

Creates a complete tileset for game development with seamlessly connecting tiles.

A tileset is a collection of 16 individual tiles that can be combined to create larger maps and environments. This endpoint generates tiles representing two terrain levels - "lower" and "upper" - that connect seamlessly when placed adjacent to each other.

Understanding Lower and Upper Terrain:

    Lower terrain: The base level terrain (e.g., water, grass, lava)
    Upper terrain: The elevated terrain level (e.g., beach, dirt path, rock)
    Transition size: Controls the visual height difference between levels. Larger transitions (0.25-0.5) create a more pronounced elevation effect, making it appear as if the upper terrain is on a higher plane

Features:

    Returns 16 individual tiles with unique IDs
    Corner-based terrain classification (NW, NE, SW, SE)
    Pre-calculated connection compatibility between tiles
    Lower and upper terrain levels for elevation variety
    Tile sizes: 16x16 or 32x32 pixels
    Seamless tile connections for map creation
    Style control via outline, shading, and detail parameters
    Reference images for style guidance
    Color palette control

Response format:

    Each tile includes: UUID, name, description, base64 image, corner data, connections
    Corner data specifies "lower" or "upper" terrain for each corner (NW, NE, SW, SE)
    Connection data lists UUIDs of compatible adjacent tiles in each direction
    Metadata includes terrain prompts and creation timestamp

Common use cases:

    Beach environments: water/sand with wet sand transitions
    Forest paths: grass/dirt with muddy transitions
    Dungeon floors: stone floor/walls with cracked stone transitions
    Snow landscapes: snow/rock with icy transitions
    Desert oases: sand/water with muddy bank transitions
    Lava caves: rock/lava with molten rock transitions

Using the Python client:

import pixellab

client = pixellab.Client(secret="YOUR_API_TOKEN")

# Generate a beach/ocean tileset
response = client.generate_tileset(
    lower_description="deep blue ocean water with gentle waves",

    tile_size=dict(width=16, height=16),
    transition_size=0.5,
    view="high top-down"
)

# Access individual tiles
for tile in response.tileset.tiles:
    print(f"Tile {tile.name}: {tile.description}")
    print(f"  Corners: NW={tile.corners.NW}, NE={tile.corners.NE}, SW={tile.corners.SW}, SE={tile.corners.SE}")
    print(f"  Can connect to {len(tile.connections)} other tiles")
    
    # Save individual tile images
    import base64

Create character with 4 directions​

Generate a character or object facing 4 cardinal directions (south, west, east, north).

This endpoint creates 4 separate rotation images plus a combined spritesheet in a 4x1 layout. Perfect for game development where you need character sprites facing all directions.

Key Features:

    Fixed 4-rotation layout (south, west, east, north)
    Individual rotation images + combined spritesheet
    Style customization (outline, shading, detail)
    Color palette support
    Character proportions customization
    Optimized for game sprites and character assets

Character Proportions:

    Use preset proportions: chibi, cartoon, stylized, realistic_male, realistic_female, heroic
    Or customize individual body proportions: head size, arm/leg length, shoulder/hip width
    All characters use the advanced mannequin template with bone scaling

Using the Python client:

import pixellab

Create character with 8 directions​

Generate a character or object facing 8 directions (all cardinal and diagonal directions).

This endpoint creates 8 rotation images in a dictionary format for easy access by direction name. Perfect for detailed movement systems in games where smooth directional changes are important.

The 8 Directions:

    south (facing down)
    south-east (diagonal down-right)
    east (facing right)
    north-east (diagonal up-right)
    north (facing up)
    north-west (diagonal up-left)
    west (facing left)
    south-west (diagonal down-left)

Key Features:

    Fixed 8-rotation layout in clockwise order starting from south
    Returns dictionary of images by direction name
    Style customization (outline, shading, detail)
    Color palette support
    Character proportions customization
    Optimized for games requiring smooth directional movement

Character Proportions:

    Use preset proportions: chibi, cartoon, stylized, realistic_male, realistic_female, heroic
    Or customize individual body proportions: head size, arm/leg length, shoulder/hip width
    All characters use the advanced mannequin template with bone scaling

Using the Python client:

import pixellab

client = pixellab.Client(secret="YOUR_API_TOKEN")

# Example: With preset proportions
response = client.generate_8_rotations(
    description="futuristic robot warrior",
    image_size=dict(width=96, height=96),
    view="low top-down",
    proportions=dict(
        type="preset",
        name="heroic"
    )
)

# Access individual images by direction
south_facing = response.images["south"]
east_facing = response.images["east"]
north_facing = response.images["north"]
west_facing = response.images["west"]
# And diagonal directions
se_facing = response.images["south-east"]
ne_facing = response.images["north-east"]
nw_facing = response.images["north-west"]
sw_facing = response.images["south-west"]

Animate character with template​

Animate an existing character with multiple frames showing movement or action.

This endpoint creates animation sequences for characters that were previously created using the create-character-with-4-directions or create-character-with-8-directions endpoints.

Key Features:

    Animate existing characters by character_id
    Support for multiple directions (or all character directions)
    Flexible frame count (2-12 frames)
    Template-based animations for consistent motion
    Asynchronous processing for multiple directions
    Automatic storage and organization

Character Requirements:

    Character must exist and belong to the authenticated user
    Character must have been created with 4 or 8 directions
    Animation will use the same template and settings as the character

Direction Handling:

    Multiple directions per request (specify via directions field)
    If directions field is None/empty, animates all available directions
    Each direction creates a separate background job
    Returns list of job IDs (one per direction)

AI Freedom Parameter:

    ai_freedom controls how closely the AI follows the template (0=strict, 1000=creative)
    Lower values produce more consistent animations
    Higher values allow more creative variations

Style Settings:

    Uses the same style settings (outline, shading, detail) as the original character by default
    Can override individual style settings in the request

Frame Count:

    Determined by the animation template (not configurable in request)
    Typically 4-6 frames for most animations

Image Size:

    Uses the same image size as the original character
    All frames have consistent dimensions
    Stored in organized folder structure

Pricing:

    Cost scales with number of frames
    Each direction is a separate request with separate cost

Background Jobs ​
Background Jobs Operations

    get/background-jobs/{job_id}

Get background job status​

Check the status and results of a background job.

This endpoint allows you to monitor the progress of background operations like character creation and animation generation. Background jobs are used for expensive operations that take time to complete.

Job Statuses:

    processing - Job is currently running
    completed - Job finished successfully
    failed - Job encountered an error

Usage Pattern:

    Create a character or animation (returns
    background_job_id
    )
    Poll this endpoint periodically to check status
    When status is
    completed
    , access results in
    last_response

Response Data:

    For character creation: character_id, directions_count, character info
    For animations: animation_id, frame_count, animation details
    Storage information and file organization details

Authentication: Requires a valid API token. You can only access jobs you created.

Error Handling:

    404: Job not found or doesn't belong to you
    Jobs are automatically cleaned up after completion

Polling Recommendations:

    Poll every 5-10 seconds while status is processing
    Stop polling once status is completed or failed
    Character creation typically takes 30-60 seconds
    Animations may take longer depending on frame count and directions
